        <h1>Muhammad Sharoon Khan</h1>
        <p>Myself:-
My name is Muhammad Sharoon Khan. I am 12 years old. I have 1 brother and 1 sister. My brother's name is Zohan and my sister’s name is Pareesa. My father’s name is Hammad and my mother’s name is Iqra. I am currently learning Mandarin Chinese, Advanced Mathematics and Coding. I have learnt abut 3% of mandarin Chinese, I have learnt a lot of advanced mathematics like trigonometry, quadratic formula, algebra, and a bit of some calculus. In programming I have learnt Python, HTML, CSS, JS and Java. It took me 5 months to learn python, it took me 1.5 days to learn HTML, it took me 1.5 days to learn CSS, it took me 8 days to learn javascript and right now am currently learning java. I am  about to be a software and website developer. I am creating website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I My coding has taken about a year because my computer had the ‘The Light Of Death’ But thankfully it was fixed in 4 months. I am definitely not being forced to being child labour. I love my parents and my life and THANKFULLY I AM A MUSLIM.
I have finished the Holy Book Of Quran 3 times and I pray everyday. I have a PC and it the chip of Intel Core i7, generation 7th. My computer works completely fine now. I am in grade 6 and my story of coding is that in EID-UL-ADHA 2022, my father’s cousin came. His name was Jibran and he was a software and a website developer. So at first I didn’t have interest but then when he told me that he was being paid $300/month, I was shocked to hear that because just sitting at a couch and writing code while in home with your parents and getting paid really good is like one of the best things of life. After that, I started with Scratch and i continued in it for 1 year. I had some really good games with it. After that I moved to Python and that time, I became really popular because of my programming skills because I recreated Minecraft in python. But i wanted to create a website. I used a lot of python apps for website development but none of them worked. After that I learned HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and instantly fell in love with it. But the problem was that now i needed to learn CSS. So I learned CSS And I actually learned all of these languages except python from codecademy. When I learned CSS, I created a whole website using HTML and CSS about Brown Bears. It had the habitat, where there are most populations of brown bears, where there are least population of brown bears, a photo of brown bears and even a video of brown bears. After that I recreated Youtube In Html And Css using a tutorial on youtube. After when I learned Html and Css, I had 2 choices:-
1. Learn C# (C Sharp)
2. Learn JS (JavaScript)
 Now the thing why I wanted to learn C# was because I wanted to create games in a software called unity. Unity is an app in which you can design very good 3D games using C#. But after that I realised that I did want to create games but I needed to create a good website because apparently Html and Css wasn’t enough. Also a lot of people were saying that JavaScript is like one of the most easiest languages in the world and I wouldn’t have any problem learning it and I will learn it in like 1 week. Well when I tried learning Javascript from codecademy, turns out, it may be easy for some people but it definitely wasn’t easy for ME. But after 3 weeks, I finally understood JaveScript and the main thing that caught was the functions. I still haven’t learned the whole JavaScript but I think I’m getting it now. Now, I have some programming languages that I HAVE to learn:-
1. C#
2. C++
3. Java
4. Arduino
Now first of all, C#. I already said that I would like to produce games but nowadays, it's difficult to get your games ahead because games like Subway Surfers, Call Of Duty, Minecraft, Fortnite and many more, these games are hard to beat because everyone lovers them. So a no to C#. Now is C++. I tried learning C++ but I quit because it was way to hard. So another no to C++. Now is Java. I have already learned JavaScript (JS) so maybe  I should learn Java. i will try. Now the final is Arduino. The thing in arduino is that it is basically robotics but you have to code. But for that I would have to buy a $20 device in which I can code in. Also I have heard that Arduino is pretty hard to learn and besides that I have no interest in Robotics. I actually like coding but however that, I LOVE MY JOB.
